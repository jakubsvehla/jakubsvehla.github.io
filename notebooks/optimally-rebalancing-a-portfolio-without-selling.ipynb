    "# Optimally rebalancing a portfolio without selling\n",
    "\n",
    "The other day, I was trying to figure out how to optimally rebalance my portfolio without selling any shares that I am currently holding. I hoped there would be some Google Sheets formula to solve the problem, so the first thing I tried was googling for some solution but I could not find anything at all. While there are tons of resources on how to rebalance a portfolio according to asset allocation, they usually assume that you can sell your current shares or short them. However, due to tax implications, I would like to avoid that. So I decided to sit down and figure out a solution myself. Since it might be useful to others as well I decided to write down the process of my arriving at the final solution step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will first look into how to optimally allocate money in a new portfolio defined by asset allocation and then how to optimally rebalance it with only buying additional shares (without selling the overweighted ones) when it drifts. Note that by rebalancing by only buying new shares you won't be able to always rebalance it perfectly with a limited budget, but that's okay with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that we are not optimizing the asset allocation itself, that's another optimization problem. We are trying to buy the shares in such a way that we follow a given asset allocation as closely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, assume that we started investing in 2013 and we decided that we will invest $\\$10\\,000$ every year. We want to have $60\\%$ in global stock markets and $40\\%$ in global bonds, which we will achieve by buying [Vanguard Total World Stock ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT) (VT) and [Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BND) (BND), respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given the budget, our goal is to buy as many shares as possible and at the same time minimize the deviation from the target allocation. The deviation from the target allocation, also called a portfolio drift, is defined as the total absolute deviation of each asset (class) from its target allocation weight divided by two, i.e.\n",
